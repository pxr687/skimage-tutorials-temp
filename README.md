## To do

- Add opening/closing to morphology page

- Maybe show the between classes variances for the Otsu method (show that it converges on same threshold?)...
  
- Notes for potential additions to Gaussian filtering section: Use gaussian from here: https://sbme-tutorials.github.io/2018/cv/notes/4_week4.html [Highlight that skimage filter is built from NumPy and SciPy - wrapper for `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter`?]
