## To do

- Add opening/closing to morphology page

- Maybe show the between classes variances for the Otsu method (show that it converges on same threshold?)...

- Add sharpening and blurring to one of the filtering pages. Other kernel types from this reference:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning/types-of-convolution-kernels/#1-identity-kernel
  
- Notes for potential additions to Gaussian filtering section: Use gaussian from here: https://sbme-tutorials.github.io/2018/cv/notes/4_week4.html [Highlight that skimage filter is built from NumPy and SciPy - wrapper for `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter`?]
