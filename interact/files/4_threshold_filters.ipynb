    "How does the Otsu threshold filter work? Conceptually, the Otsu method involves splitting the histogram into two parts, lots of times, and comparing different splits for how well they separate pixels into two classes, based on a specific numeric metric. The histogram, for each threshold, is split at the center one of the bin intervals.\n",

    "Since the Otsu method relies on some the \"mechanics\" of histograms, let's \"deconstruct\" the histogram in the center of the plot above, to see how the method works. To perform this deconstruction, we can use the `np.histogram()` function. We give it a flattened 1-D image array (e.g. flattened with the `.ravel()` method), and we tell it a number of bins to use. Again, we will use the sensible value of 128 bins. (*Note*: you could also use `ski.exposure.histogram()` here, for similar results).\n",
    "\n",
    "`np.histogram()` will return two arrays. The first is the pixel count within each bin, so in this case we will get 128 individual numbers, because there are 128 bins. We will call this array `counts`. These `counts` determine the height of the histogram over each bin. The first `count` is for the first bin, the second `count` is for the second bin, and so on, as we move along the $x$-axis from left to right.\n",
