    "# Scikit-image via NumPy and SciPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial series covering foundational image manipulation and processing using [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org) and two of its constituent libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org). The tutorials first cover the mechanics of representing images as NumPy arrays, which are the fundamental image representations that Scikit-image uses. Later tutorials focus on different classes of image processing operations. These operations are demonstrated first using NumPy and SciPy, followed by their implementation in Scikit-image, with a focus on how NumPy and SciPy are often being used \"under the hood\".\n",

    "## Many sections are interactive\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interact with many of the sections in this textbook, with the “Interact” button at the top of the page. This will take you to a free online service that allows you to execute the code in the section, to generate the tables and figures. \n",
    "\n",
    "**There are exercises on most pages which you can complete by writing your own code.** We also encourage you to play with the code on the pages by changing the code and running it to better understand the behaviour of the objects and functions."
