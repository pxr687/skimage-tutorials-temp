    "# Morphology\n",
    "\n",
    "[Morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology) is the mathematical study of shapes and has numerous applications in image processing. As such, Scikit-image has a dedicated module (`ski.morphology`) for associated functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We already encountered structuring elements - (of which kernels are one type) - on [earlier](4_threshold_filters) [pages](5_mean_filter). A structuring element is a grid of a certain shape - you can think of it as a \"template\" - which is used to define the \"neighbourhood\" of pixels which an image processing operation affects. \n",
    "\n",
    "A (3, 3) structuring element can be applied as a square which affects 9 pixels - we might alter the image by centering this structuring element over every pixel, and replacing each pixel with the mean of the other pixels in its \"neighbourhood\", for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/kernel_general.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also recall that we need a strategy for pixels at the edge of the image, where we center the structuring element on a pixel where part of the structuring element \"falls off\" the edge of the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/kernel_hit_the_edge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Options here including \"padding\" the empty structuring element locations with a repeated value (like 0), or just duplicating the existing pixels at the edge of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen structuring elements applied during filtering operations, courtesy of the `ski.filters` module. Morphological operations also make use of structuring elements, though in morphological operations, structuring elements are binary (contain only 0s and 1s). \n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological operations differ from the filtering operations we have seen previously because they are specifically related to the shape (...or, well, [*morphology*](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci773s1c/lectures/ImageProcessing-html/topic4.htm)) of features with in the image. This contrasts with operations like [mean filtering](5_mean_filter) which \"spread\" pixel values around within a neighbourhood, rather than identifying and altering features with a specific shape/morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structuring elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Because morphological operations are part of image processing, they involve the modification of array pixel values, which is [all image processing is](3_skimage_processing_from_numpy_and_scipy). In morphological operations, the structural element will alter pixel values *depending upon the match between the shape of the structural element and the shape of the pixels in the \"neighbourhood\" of the structural element*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structural element, typically, is centered once on every pixel in an image, and this central pixel is modified (or not) depending upon the match between the shape of the structural element and the shape depicted by the pixels in that neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make ourselves a simple binary image, so we can clearly see the effect of the foundational morphological operations:"

However, it will only perform this lowering *if the pixels in the neighbourhood do not match the shape of the structuring element*, else it will leave the central pixel unchanged.\n",
