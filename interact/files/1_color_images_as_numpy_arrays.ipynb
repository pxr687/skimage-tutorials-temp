    "\n",
    "Recall that we referred to the 2D arrays that we used at the start of this tutorial as *single-channel image arrays*? The 3D arrays we just created are  *three-channel image arrays*. This means that each array pixel has three values, one in each slice of the 3D stacks we created. You can think of each slice as being one *color channel*. Each color channel controls the amount of a specific color in the image, depending on the values of the array pixels in that slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these three-channel arrays, when Matplotlib produces a two-dimensional *display image* (e.g. the matrix with colored squares along the diagonal and black squares elsewhere). However, behind this 2D display image there are three slices in the third dimension, each with the same number of rows and columns as the final 2D display image. Each pixel (e.g. each array element) in the display image gets its color information from a mix of the corresponding elements in each slice in the 3D image array.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, the first slice is the red channel, the second slice is the green channel and the third slice is the blue channel. The intensities in each color channel are *mixed* to produce the rendered 2D image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/color_channels_all.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, despite the visualisations of our array containing only one primary color, the color channels are in fact being mixed together. However, because we have set two of the slices to contain only 0's, we are essentially \"switching off\" those color channels in the final mix (e.g. in the image displayed by Matplotlib).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other non-primary colors can be created using different blends of the primary colors (red, green, blue) in each slice of the array. For `float64` image data, you can think of 0 as meaning 0% and 1 as meaning 100%, 0.5 meaning 50% and so on. So a 1 in the red slice means 100% red is mixed in for that pixel, along with the percentages from the other color channels (which in the arrays above, are 0's).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this by choosing intensity values randomly for each color channel. The function `np.random.uniform()` can supply us with three random decimal numbers between 0 and 1. Run the cell below a few times if you are using this tutorial interactively, to see the random draw a few times:"
