    "# Images as NumPy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "This page explores how images can be represented as NumPy arrays. To get\n",
    "started, let's think about the meaning of the word \"image\".  The *intuitive\n",
    "meaning* is roughly \"a picture of something\", or perhaps more broadly \"a\n",
    "visual representation of something\". This is the familiar meaning which\n",
    "applies to images we encounter in everyday life, like advertisement posters,\n",
    "paintings, drawings, photographs and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An image - in scientific computing - is *an array that has at least two dimensions*. Depending on your background and familiarity with the topic, this definition may sound more or less strange. We assure you that the two meanings are consistent with one other. However, each meaning refers to different, but overlapping, sets of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an image — in the intuitive sense — printed on a piece of paper. The\n",
    "image has two dimensions, one dimension runs along the *length* of the paper\n",
    "and one runs along the *width* of the paper. Now imagine the *computer file*\n",
    "that was used to print the image onto the paper (e.g. the image file that was\n",
    "sent to a run-of-the-mill printer to produce the printed image). The computer\n",
    "file must contain information which tells the printer what to put where, along\n",
    "each dimension of the piece of paper. For instance, consider some location in\n",
    "the middle of the image.  Should that location contain black, white, grey or\n",
    "a colour? By controlling these things, the information contained in the file\n",
    "will ultimately determine the look of the printed image (e.g. what it is\n",
    "a picture *of*).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/printed_paper.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file and resulting printed image might depict an object that was not\n",
    "originally created on a computer. The image may be of an oil painting, for\n",
    "example. Things like paintings fall under the intuitive meaning of \"image\",\n",
    "but, until they are represented on a computer, they do not fall under the\n",
    "technical meaning of \"image\". A painting is not an array of numbers, but\n",
    "the computer file which represents it is. The technical meaning of \"image\"\n",
    "refers to the computer representations of these things (e.g. a scan or\n",
    "photograph of a painting), as well as to other inherently digital images like\n",
    "digital photographs, CT scans, MRI scans etc. (more on these\n",
    "[later](2_skimage_intro)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we take an image (in the intuitive sense) and *then* represent it on\n",
    "a computer (by taking a digital photograph or scanning it etc.). This can be\n",
    "referred to as *digitizing* an image. When digitizing, we take an image in the\n",
    "intuitive sense and convert it to an image in the technical sense, by\n",
    "representing it as an at least two-dimensional array of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a deeper understanding of the computer representation of images, let's\n",
    "create an image, in the technical sense of a two-dimensional array, and then\n",
    "*view it* as an image, in the intuitive sense, as a visual representation that\n",
    "we can look at as we would any picture."

    "\n",
    "On this page we have examined the fundamental components of computer images:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Images are (at least) two-dimensional arrays of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For small/low-resolution arrays, the values in the array will be displayed on more pixels than there are values in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number at each location in an image array determines the pixel intensity (gray-level) in a 2D array. We have seen that different `colormap`s can display this information using different color gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These principles apply both to very simple and very complex images.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the [next page](1_color_images_as_numpy_arrays), we will look at the representation of color in NumPy image arrays."
