    "# Introducing Scikit-image\n",
    "\n",
    "[Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org) (`skimage`) is a powerful image processing package which is built in a large part from NumPy and SciPy, and uses NumPy arrays as its fundamental image representations. This page will show some foundational aspects of `skimage`, focusing on its coherence with the NumPy image array concepts we saw on the last two pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Images are arrays, arrays are images\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, the technical definition of an image is *an (at least) two-dimensional array*. We know that each element of an image array (an \"array pixel\") contains information about the gray-level or color of that element. Perhaps obviously, these fundamental principles apply equally to Scikit-image, given that it represents images as NumPy arrays. The table below outlines how images are represented in `skimage` - you'll notice it is identical to the principles we have seen for representing images in NumPy: \n",
