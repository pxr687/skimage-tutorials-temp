    "When compared to the other local filters we have seen, the median filter uses the same process of \"walking\" through the image with a small array which denfines the \"local neighbourhood\" of each pixel. In median filtering, you can *loosely* think of this small array as a kernel, but there are some major differences in the calculations, so let's call it the \"neighbourhood array\" instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with the other kernels we have seen, the \"neighbourhood array\" is centered on every pixel during the filtering operation. The central pixel value is replaced with a number computed from the other values in the local neighbourhood, e.g. the other pixel values under the \"neighbourhood array\".  However, instead of *convolving* the neighbourhood array and the image, as we would for a mean filter or Gaussian filter etc., the median filter, shockingly, takes the median value of the pixels under the small array. \n",

Calculating the median utilizes ranking and indexing, and cannot be expressed as set of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions etc, in the way that calculating a mean can, for instance.\n",
