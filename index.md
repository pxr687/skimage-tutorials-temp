# Scikit-image via NumPy and SciPy

This is a tutorial series covering foundational image manipulation and processing using [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org) and two of its constituent libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org). The tutorials first cover the mechanics of representing images as NumPy arrays, which are the fundamental image representations that Scikit-image uses. Later tutorials focus on different classes of image processing operations. These operations are demonstrated first using NumPy and SciPy, followed by their implementation in Scikit-image, with a focus on how NumPy and SciPy are often being used "under the hood".

## Many sections are interactive

You can interact with many of the sections in this textbook, with the “Interact” button at the top of the page. This will take you to a free online service that allows you to execute the code in the section, to generate the tables and figures. 

**There are exercises on most pages which you can complete by writing your own code.** We also encourage you to play with the code on the pages by changing the code and running it to better understand the behaviour of the objects and functions.
