# Scikit-image via NumPy and SciPy

This is a tutorial series covering foundational image manipulation and processing using [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org). The series also explores image processing using two of the foundational libraries that Scikit-image is built from: [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org). 

The tutorials first cover the mechanics of representing images as NumPy arrays. NumPy arrays are the fundamental image representations that Scikit-image works with. Later tutorials focus on different types of image processing. First, it is shown how different image processing operations can be implemented using NumPy and SciPy functions, then how to implement more complex algorithms with Scikit-image, with a focus on how NumPy and SciPy functions are often being used "under the hood".

## Many sections are interactive

You can interact with many of the sections in this textbook, with the “Interact” button at the top of the page. This will take you to a free online service that allows you to execute the code in the section, to generate the tables and figures. 

**There are exercises on most pages which you can complete by writing your own code.** We also encourage you to play with the code on the pages by changing the code and running it to better understand the behaviour of the objects and functions.
