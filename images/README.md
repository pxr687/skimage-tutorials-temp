# Images and copyright

## `xeno` images

`xenonorph.jpg` is from <https://stockcake.com/i/alien-head-close-up_1354662_1093149>, with a [public-domain license](https://stockcake.com/info/license).

The requested attribution is — photo by

`xeno_blur.png` derives from Gaussian smoothing of the `xenomorph.jpg` image
above, as part of an exercise solution in the [page on Gaussian
blur](../6_gaussian_sharpening_edge) — see the code on that page.  It has the
same license as the original.

`xeno_ex_1.png` similarly results from processing in the [page on
morpology](../8_morphology), and has the same license as the original.

## `camera.png`, `*_camera.png`, `shoegaze.png`

These images are all generated from Scikit-image standard `camera` image:

- `camera.png` results from a simple save of the Sckit-image standard `coffee`
  dataset; `ski.io.imsave('images/coffee.png', ski.data.coffee())`
- `corrupted_camera.png` from the [color
  page](../1_color_images_as_numpy_arrays);
- `noisy_camera.png` from the [skimage intro page](../2_skimage_intro);
- `shoegaze.png` also from the [skimage intro page](../2_skimage_intro);
- `masked_camera.png` from the [Numpy / Scipy page](../ 3_skimage_processing_from_numpy_and_scipy).

## `interverted_bricks.png`

These images are all derived from the standard `ski.data.bricks()` dataset.

From the [Numpy / Scipy page](../ 3_skimage_processing_from_numpy_and_scipy).

## `inverted_cat_purple.png`

Derived from `ski.data.cat()`.

From the [Numpy / Scipy page](../ 4_skimage_processing_from_numpy_and_scipy).

## `colorwheel.png`, `gray_wheel.png`

Derived from `ski.data.colorwheel()`.

- `colorwheel.png`: result of `ski.io.imsave('images/colorwheel.png',
  ski.data.colorwheel())`
- `gray_wheel.png` from the [Numpy / Scipy page](../
  3_skimage_processing_from_numpy_and_scipy).
