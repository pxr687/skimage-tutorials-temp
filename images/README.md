`xeno_blur.png` derives from Gaussian smoothing of the `xenomorph.jpg` image
above, as part of an exercise solution in the [page on Gaussian
blur](../6_gaussian_sharpening_edge) — see the code on that page.  It has the
same license as the original.

`xeno_ex_1.png` similarly results from processing in the [page on
morpology](../8_morphology), and has the same license as the original.
